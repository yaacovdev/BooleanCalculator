Boolean Calculator (Console) v. 1.1

This calculator is able to find all solutions for boolean variables in the problem.

INSTRUCTIONS:
In the promt, in console, type the problem you wish to solve. 

The NOT operators are (!, NOT, ~, ', Â¬)
The AND operators are (*, AND, ^, .)
The OR operators are (+, OR, V, v)
The XOR (EXCLUSIVE OR) operators are (@, XOR, EXCLSOR)

If you want to use operator characters as variables you must write them inside curly brackets '{', '}'.

example problem: (p AND q) OR (q AND NOT {v})\

Note: The software neglects spaces for operators, meaning that if you type in 'v' or 'V' inside a variable name, it will try to use that 
char in the input string as an operator, often resulting in error.

The software is written in javascript and must be started with running BooleanCalculator.js file. 
In Node.js you can start the program with "node BooleanCalculator.js"
